function find_files has arguments: suffix and path. The function recursively searches for all files in the given path directory and its subdirectories that end with the given suffix, and returns a list of their absolute paths.

The function first checks if the given path is a file or a directory. If it is a file, it checks if the file name ends with the given suffix. If it does, it returns a list containing the absolute path of the file. If it doesn't, it returns an empty list.

If the given path is a directory, the function gets a list of all the files and directories in the directory using the os.listdir function. It then iterates over each item in the list and recursively calls the find_files function on each subdirectory. The results of each recursive call are concatenated to the list_paths list using the extend method.

Finally, the function returns the list_paths list, which contains the absolute paths of all the files in the given path directory and its subdirectories that end with the given suffix.

Big0 is O(n) because it depend on the total number of files and directories in the given path directory and its subdirectories and the function recursively searches through each directory and checks each file to see if it ends with the given suffix
